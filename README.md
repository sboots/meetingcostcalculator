Ever wondered how much your team meetings cost? The [Meeting Cost Calculator](http://meetingcostcalculator.ca/) lets you calculate an estimated cost for meetings, using the standard pay rates used by a variety of public sector organizations.

**As of October 2019, this repository has moved to a new location.** For the latest updates to the Meeting Cost Calculator, see the following:

- [Website repository (Canada)](https://github.com/meetingcostcalculator/meeting-cost-calculator-hugo-ca) for meetingcostcalculator.ca, powered by Hugo and Bootstrap 4
- [Data repository](https://github.com/meetingcostcalculator/meeting-cost-calculator-data) containing CSV data for public sector pay rates
- [Helper scripts](https://github.com/meetingcostcalculator/meeting-cost-calculator-helpers) to convert pay rate data into JSON format

This repository contains the shared [Issue tracker](https://github.com/sboots/meetingcostcalculator/issues) for the three repositories above, including past entries from the original project repository.

You can find the [archived source code for the original meeting cost calculator here](https://github.com/meetingcostcalculator/meeting-cost-calculator-classic).

Feedback and improvements are welcome! You can [create an issue](https://github.com/sboots/meetingcostcalculator/issues) or [get in touch](https://twitter.com/sboots/) via Twitter. Thanks to all contributors!
